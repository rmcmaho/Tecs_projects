// I/O handling: This program runs an infinite loop that listens to the keyboard input.
// When a key is pressed (any key), the program blackens the screen, i.e. writes "black" in every pixel.
// When no key is pressed, the screen should be cleared.

// You may choose to blacken and clear the screen in any visual order, as long as pressing a key continuously for long enough will result in a fully blackened screen and not pressing any key for long enough will result in a cleared screen.
// This program has a test script (Fill.tst) but no compare file â€“ it should be checked visually by inspecting the simulated screen.
